<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is a school project that aims to monitor a system. It is written in python and uses the flask library to create an api and a web interface. It also uses the psutil library to monitor the system and the pymongo library to store the data in a mongodb database.

This app will receive updates in the future since it is a projetct i'd loved to work on.

### Built For

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Clone the repository on your machine

Be sure having python installed on your machine

### Prerequisites

You will need python installed on your machine.

If you want to use the docker-compose.yml file provided in the /api folder, be sure having docker installed and ready on the machine

### Installation

2. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ogb4n/alpha_monit-app.git
   ```

3. Go into the /app folder and edit the `config.json.example` file <br>
   it should look like this:

   ```js
   {
    "ports":[ {your list of ports} ],
    "log_dir" : "/var/log/monit/",
    "rapport_dir" : "/var/monit/reports/",
    "local_api_mode": true
    }
   ```

   You can change the ports to monitor, the log directory and the report directory. You can also change the local_api_mode to false if you want to use the web interface on another machine, or to turn it off.

   _More values will be added in the future_

<br>

4. Still in the /app folder, run the ./install.sh script as admin to install the app

   ```sh
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```

   This will install the app as a service and will start it.

   The api will be available at 'http://localhost:8085/'

 <br>

If you enabled the local_api_mode, you can now go to http://localhost:8085/ to see the web interface.

### You disabled the local_api_mode

Otherwise, you can run the app with the command

```sh
monit
```

and use `monit -h` to see the available commands.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

This app is meant to be used as a service. It will monitor the system and store the data in a mongodb database. You can then use the web interface to see the data.

You can also use the command line to see the data, especially if you do not want to export your datas but prefer storing it on the system. Use `monit -h` to see the available commands.
